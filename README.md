Applied Deep Learning to predict drug-target binding affinity
Deep-DTA addresses the challenge of predicting drug-target (DT) interaction binding affinities, moving beyond traditional binary classification methods. It proposes a deep learning model leveraging only sequence information from both targets and drugs, employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for representation. The results indicate that this approach effectively predicts binding affinities.
